# How to deploy
What? Do you still need to ask? Download index.html and open it directly. Except for the background image, there are no external resources.

# Development process
First of all, thanks to several open source query codes on Github. This project was based on their projects and modified to use GPT4. I only manually modified a few css throughout the process.
